            For groups with at least 30 people we suggest the Italian buffet, inspired on the regional Italian cuisine. It consists of around fifty dishes, half hot, half cold. The price for the buffet, without drinks and dessert, is &euro;35 per person. A minimum of 30 people will always be charged, even if for example only 23 people are present.
            <br />
            Another possiblity are our choices of group dishes and from the extensive <a href="/menu.pdf">menu</a> from downstairs. 
            <br />
            Up to 15 people can eat &agrave; la carte.
